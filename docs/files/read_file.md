# Read File

Zero-dependency Python snippets for reading files using the standard library.

4 snippets available in this sub-category.

---

## Simple

###  Read entire file as string

`file` `read` `string` `open`

Read entire file content as a single string

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
print(content)
```

!!! note "Notes"
    - Use 'r' mode for text files
    - File is automatically closed after reading
    - Returns empty string if file is empty

### Read file with encoding

`file` `read` `encoding` `utf-8`

Read file with specific encoding

```python
with open("file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()
print(content)
```

!!! note "Notes"
    - Always specify encoding for international text
    - UTF-8 is the most common encoding
    - Handles special characters properly

## Complex

###  Read file with error handling

`file` `read` `error-handling` `function` `encoding`

Read file with comprehensive error handling and encoding support

```python
def read_file_safe(filename, encoding="utf-8"):
    """Read file with comprehensive error handling."""
    try:
        with open(filename, "r", encoding=encoding) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found")
        return None
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: No permission to read '{filename}'")
        return None
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Unable to decode '{filename}' with {encoding} encoding")
        return None


content = read_file_safe("file.txt")
if content:
    print(content)
```

!!! note "Notes"
    - Handles common file reading errors
    - Returns None on error for easy checking
    - Supports custom encoding
    - Provides helpful error messages

### Read file in chunks

`file` `read` `chunks` `generator` `memory-efficient`

Read large files in chunks to manage memory efficiently

```python
def read_file_chunks(filename, chunk_size=1024):
    """Read file in chunks to handle large files efficiently."""
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            yield chunk


# Process large file in chunks
for chunk in read_file_chunks("large_file.txt", chunk_size=4096):
    print(f"Processing chunk: {len(chunk)} characters")
    # Process chunk here
```

!!! note "Notes"
    - Uses generator to yield chunks
    - Prevents loading entire large file into memory
    - Customizable chunk size
    - Useful for processing large log files or datasets
